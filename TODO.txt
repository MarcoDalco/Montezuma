1) Provide a real-world example use (not RecordAll) with command-line
2) Provide a UberJar with all the dependencies?
3) Promote it
4) Switch to Gradle?
5) Disable the TurnOff/TurnOn invocations on Recording in Cases
6) Run with Coverage to find and remove dead code and unused options, then:
7) Create a true "WriteAll" which also tests the currently-untested options (single-file/multi-file tests).
8) Automatically build with Jenkins - tried again.
